"""Focused tests for the TFP investment-gating correction.

Confirms that ordinary net capital investment feeds TFP growth ONLY when a real
productivity-investment planner is active. Under the default
``NoProductivityInvestmentPlanner`` a configured ``SimpleTFPGrowth`` base rate is
followed cleanly (capital investment does not alter TFP), while ``NoOpTFPGrowth``
remains exactly inert. The investment-induced channel is preserved as an explicit
option (selecting a real planner re-enables it).

The gating lives in ``Firms.compute_tfp_growth`` / ``Firms._investment_drives_tfp``;
these are exercised on a light stub so no full simulation is built.
