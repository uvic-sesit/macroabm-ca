"""Module implementing the country-level economic model.

This module provides the core Country class that integrates all economic agents,
markets, and processes within a single national economy. It orchestrates:

1. Economic Agents:
   - Individuals (workers, consumers)
   - Households (consumption, investment, housing decisions)
   - Firms (production, pricing, employment)
   - Banks (lending, deposit-taking)
   - Government entities (public spending, services)
   - Central bank (monetary policy)

2. Markets:
   - Labor market (employment, wages)
   - Credit market (loans, interest rates)
   - Housing market (property sales, rentals)
   - Goods market (production, consumption)

3. Economic Processes:
   - Production and consumption
   - Price formation and inflation
   - Wage determination
   - Credit creation and allocation
   - Fiscal and monetary policy
   - International trade

The model runs in discrete timesteps (typically quarterly but configurable),
with each iteration updating all agents and markets in sequence according
to their behavioral rules and interactions.

# Ceiling on the OBPS per-unit charge, as a multiple of the good's own price.
#
# This is a POLITICAL-ECONOMY bound, not merely a numerical guard.  A carbon charge that
# more than doubled the price of a good would not survive: the pricing regime would be
# changed before firms paid it, so a model that lets the charge run past that point is
# projecting a policy that would not exist.  Capping is the more realistic assumption.
#
# It also happens to make the per-sector normalisation safe.  Dividing the sector's OBPS
# cost by that sector's own production is the economically right per-unit charge, but the
# denominator can approach zero and send the quotient to absurd values (measured:
# 3.18e+07 against prices of order 10).  That was invisible while the charge only informed
# price-setting -- which is multiplied by price_setting_speed_cp = 0 -- but is fatal once
# it feeds realised input costs, where it produced NaNs in goods-market clearing.
#
# The cap is logged when it binds: frequent binding means the denominator is degenerate
# and the sector's production path needs attention, not the cap.

class Country:
    """A complete national economy with interacting agents and markets.

    This class represents a single country's economy, integrating all economic agents
    (individuals, households, firms, banks, government) and markets (labor, credit,
    housing, goods). It manages their interactions and evolution over time.

    The economy operates in discrete timesteps, with each iteration:
    1. Updating exchange rates and monetary conditions
    2. Running agent-level planning and decision-making
    3. Clearing all markets sequentially
    4. Recording economic outcomes and updating metrics

    The timestep length is configurable (typically quarterly) and determined by
    how the input data is preprocessed (see ICIOReader's yearly_factor parameter).

        This method coordinates the comprehensive updating of all economic metrics after markets

        economic indicators across eight major categories:

        1. Economic Indicators:
           - Price indices (PPI, CPI)
           - Economic growth rates
           - House price indices
           - Labor market metrics (employment, unemployment)
           - Rental market aggregates

        2. Global Trade and Capital Formation:
           - International trade flows
           - Import/export tracking
           - Gross fixed capital formation
           - Input costs (intermediate and capital)

        3. Firm Production and Costs:
           - Production volumes and nominal values
           - Wages and labor costs
           - Inventory management
           - Input utilization
           - Emissions (if enabled)

        4. Firm Financial Metrics:
           - Sales and revenue
           - Profits and taxes
           - Corporate financial positions
           - Insolvency metrics
           - Debt aggregates

        5. Individual and Household Income:
           - Employment income
           - Social transfers
           - Financial asset income
           - Rental income
           - Total household income

        6. Household Wealth and Consumption:
           - Consumption patterns
           - Investment decisions
           - Wealth positions
           - Debt management
           - Insolvency handling

        7. Government and Banking:
           - Tax collection
           - Government revenue and deficit
           - Bank profits and equity
           - Interest payments
           - Market share metrics

        8. GDP and National Accounts:
           - GDP components
           - Value added
           - National income
           - Sectoral balances

        The method ensures consistency between micro-level agent behaviors and macro-level
        economic outcomes, maintaining stock-flow consistency throughout the economy.

        Note:
            This method should be called after all markets (goods, labor, credit, housing)
            have cleared and agents have executed their planned transactions.

        Side Effects:
            Updates numerous time series variables across all economic agents and markets,
            reflecting the realized outcomes of the current period's economic activity.
