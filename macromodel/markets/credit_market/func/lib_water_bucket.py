"""Water bucket algorithm implementation for credit market clearing.

This module implements a sophisticated credit market clearing mechanism based on the water bucket
algorithm, which models credit flows like water flowing through a network of interconnected
buckets. The algorithm provides efficient and fair allocation of credit between lenders and
borrowers while respecting various financial and regulatory constraints.

Core Concepts:

1. Water Bucket Analogy:
   - Credit supply sources (banks) are like water sources
   - Credit demand sinks (borrowers) are like buckets to be filled
   - Credit flows are like water flowing through pipes
   - Priorities determine which buckets get filled first
   - Minimum fill rates ensure basic credit access

2. Credit Flow Management:
   - Bank lending preferences: Control outflow from sources
   - Borrower credit limits: Control inflow to sinks
   - Interest rate adjustments: Modify flow rates based on prices
   - Priority-based routing: Direct flows to critical borrowers first

3. Interest Rate Sensitivity:
   - Temperature parameter controls interest rate sensitivity
   - Lower temperatures → more rate-sensitive allocation
   - Higher temperatures → more uniform allocation
   - Exponential decay model for rate effects

4. Priority Systems:
   - Deterministic vs stochastic priority assignment
   - High-priority borrowers get first access
   - Minimum fill rates for critical sectors
   - Risk-based preferences

Key Functions:
- get_trade_proportions: Calculates rate-adjusted credit flows
- fill_buckets: Core water bucket allocation algorithm
- get_creditor_priorities: Determines lender order (stochastic/deterministic)
- clear_water_bucket: Main credit market clearing implementation

Example:
Consider three banks and three borrowers:
1. Bank A: Conservative lender, low rates
2. Bank B: High capacity, higher rates
3. Bank C: Small lender, specialized focus

The algorithm will:
1. Adjust credit flows based on interest rate differences
2. Prioritize critical borrower demands
3. Ensure minimum credit to each sector
4. Optimize remaining allocation efficiently

    """Calculate interest rate-adjusted credit allocation proportions.

    This function adjusts historical credit allocation patterns based on current
    interest rates and preferences. It uses a temperature parameter to control
    rate sensitivity and handles special treatment of different lending sectors.

    The adjustment process:
    1. For origin proportions (lender side):
       - Applies rate sensitivity using exponential decay
       - Higher rates → Lower proportion (exp(-temperature * rate))
       - Normalizes to maintain sum = 1 for each destination

    2. For destination proportions (borrower side):
       - Maintains historical patterns with sector adjustments
       - Applies real sector prioritization
       - Normalizes to maintain sum = 1 for each origin

        price_temperature: Interest rate sensitivity parameter
            Higher values → More sensitive to rate differences
            Lower values → More uniform allocation
        distribution_type: How to combine capacity and rate weights
            "multiplicative" or "additive"
        seller_minimum_fill: Minimum fill rate guaranteed to lenders [0,1]
        buyer_minimum_fill_macro: Minimum fill rate for macro borrowers [0,1]
        buyer_minimum_fill_micro: Minimum fill rate for micro borrowers [0,1]
        deterministic: Whether to use deterministic priority ordering
        consider_buyer_priorities: Whether to respect borrower priority levels
        sell_high_prio_only: Whether to only process high-priority lenders
        buy_high_prio_only: Whether to only process high-priority borrowers
        from_country: Optional index of origin sector for bilateral clearing
        to_country: Optional index of destination sector for bilateral clearing
        origin_trade_proportions: Optional proportions for lending flows
        destin_trade_proportions: Optional proportions for borrowing flows
        exclude_row: Whether to exclude external sectors from clearing
        with_buyer_value_type: Optional filter for borrower value types

    Example:
    Consider a three-sector credit market:
    - Sector A: Major lender (1000 units), competitive rates (5%)
    - Sector B: High credit demand (800 units), higher rates (6%)
    - Sector C: Critical sector needs (200 units), limited supply

    The algorithm will:
    1. Ensure minimum credit to critical sectors
    2. Allocate remaining credit based on rate competitiveness
    3. Respect historical lending patterns if specified
    4. Handle any excess demand through additional mechanisms

    Notes:
    - The algorithm is highly configurable through its parameters
    - It can operate at different levels of granularity (sector/agent)
    - Supports both deterministic and stochastic matching
    - Handles special cases like external sectors and priority borrowers
