"""Credit market clearing implementations.

This module provides different strategies for clearing the credit market, matching
lenders (banks) with borrowers (firms and households) while respecting various
constraints and priorities. It implements multiple clearing mechanisms:

1. Default Clearing:
   - Interest rate based matching
   - Risk assessment and constraints
   - Regulatory compliance

2. Poledna Clearing:
   - Simplified firm-focused clearing
   - Basic capital requirements
   - Risk-weighted allocation

3. Water Bucket Clearing:
   - Network flow based allocation
   - Priority-based lending
   - Minimum fill rates

Each clearing mechanism handles:
- Capital adequacy requirements
- Risk assessment criteria
- Interest rate determination
- Loan type preferences
- Default risk management

    This class defines the interface and common functionality for all credit market
    clearing implementations. It handles the matching of lenders (banks) with

    The clearing process follows these general steps:
    1. Assessment of bank lending capacity
    2. Evaluation of borrower creditworthiness
    3. Interest rate determination
    4. Loan allocation and origination

    This implementation models credit allocation as a network flow problem, where
    credit supply and demand are distributed through the network like water flowing
    through buckets. The algorithm:

    1. Credit Supply Management:
       - Uses bank preferences for different loan types
       - Adjusts supply based on NPL rates
       - Respects capital adequacy requirements

    2. Priority-Based Allocation:
       - Supports both deterministic and stochastic creditor selection
       - Uses interest rates to determine priorities
       - Enforces minimum fill rates

    3. Multi-Stage Clearing:
       - Clears each loan type separately
       - Maintains running totals of lending/borrowing
       - Updates bank portfolio composition

    Key Features:
    - Network flow optimization for efficient allocation
    - Support for all loan types
    - Risk-sensitive credit supply
    - Interest rate based prioritization
    - Regulatory compliance
