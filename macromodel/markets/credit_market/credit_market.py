"""Credit market implementation for macroeconomic agent-based model.

This module implements a sophisticated credit market system that manages lending relationships
between banks, firms, and households. It handles multiple types of loans including:

1. Firm Loans:
   - Short-term loans: Working capital, operational expenses
   - Long-term loans: Capital investment, expansion

2. Household Loans:
   - Consumption loans: Personal loans, credit lines
   - Mortgage loans: Home purchases, refinancing
   - Payday loans: Short-term emergency credit

The market clearing mechanism considers:
- Bank lending capacity and risk appetite
- Borrower creditworthiness and collateral
- Interest rate determination
- Non-performing loan (NPL) dynamics
- Regulatory constraints

Key Features:
- Multi-agent lending relationships
- Dynamic interest rate adjustment
- Risk-based credit allocation
- Loan lifecycle management
- Default handling

    This class implements the core credit market functionality, managing the interactions
    between financial institutions (banks) and borrowers (firms and households). It handles

    The market maintains state information about all outstanding loans including:

    - Interest rates
    - Payment schedules
    - Default status
