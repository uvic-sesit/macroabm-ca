"""Housing market clearing mechanisms and algorithms.

This module implements various algorithms for matching buyers/renters with
properties in the housing market. It provides an abstract base class for
market clearing and several concrete implementations with different matching
strategies.

The module supports:
- Both sales and rental markets
- Price-based matching
- Priority-based allocation
- Multiple clearing strategies

Key components:
1. HousingMarketClearer: Abstract base class defining the interface
2. NoHousingMarketClearer: Null implementation for testing
3. DefaultHousingMarketClearer: Simple price-based matching
4. AutomaticHousingMarketClearer: Optimized matching using linear assignment
