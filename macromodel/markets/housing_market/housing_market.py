class HousingMarket:
    """Housing market model implementing property transactions and rental agreements.

    This class implements a comprehensive housing market model that handles both
    property sales and rental agreements. It manages property valuations, market
    clearing mechanisms, and tracks various market metrics over time.

    Key Features:
    1. Property Management:
       - Track property ownership and occupancy
       - Update property valuations
       - Monitor rental status
       - Handle property transactions

    2. Market Clearing:
       - Match buyers with sellers
       - Match tenants with landlords
       - Process transactions
       - Update ownership records

    3. Market Analysis:
       - Track price-to-value ratios
       - Monitor rent-to-value ratios
       - Calculate market statistics
       - Generate market reports

    4. Time Series Tracking:
       - Property values over time
       - Transaction volumes
       - Price and rent distributions
       - Market efficiency metrics

    The model supports:
    - Owner-occupied and rental properties
    - Multiple property ownership
    - Vacant properties
    - Price discovery mechanisms
    - Market clearing algorithms
