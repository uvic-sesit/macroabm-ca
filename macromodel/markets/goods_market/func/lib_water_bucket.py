"""Water bucket algorithm implementation for market clearing.

This module implements a sophisticated market clearing mechanism based on the water bucket
algorithm, which models trade flows like water flowing through a network of interconnected
buckets. The algorithm provides efficient and fair allocation of goods between buyers and
sellers while respecting various economic constraints.

Core Concepts:

1. Water Bucket Analogy:
   - Supply sources are like water sources (taps)
   - Demand sinks are like buckets to be filled
   - Trade flows are like water flowing through pipes
   - Priorities determine which buckets get filled first
   - Minimum fill rates ensure basic needs are met

2. Trade Flow Management:
   - Origin trade proportions: Control outflow from sources
   - Destination trade proportions: Control inflow to sinks
   - Price-based adjustments: Modify flow rates based on prices
   - Priority-based routing: Direct flows to critical sectors first

3. Price Sensitivity:
   - Temperature parameter controls price sensitivity
   - Lower temperatures → more price-sensitive allocation
   - Higher temperatures → more uniform allocation
   - Exponential decay model for price effects

4. Priority Systems:
   - Deterministic vs stochastic priority assignment
   - High-priority buyers get first access
   - Minimum fill rates for critical sectors
   - Domestic vs international preferences

Key Functions:
- get_trade_proportions: Calculates price-adjusted trade flows
- fill_buckets: Core water bucket allocation algorithm
- get_seller_priorities: Determines seller order (stochastic/deterministic)
- clear_water_bucket: Main market clearing implementation

Example:
Consider three countries trading steel:
1. Country A: Major producer, competitive prices
2. Country B: High domestic demand, higher prices
3. Country C: Small producer, critical industries

The algorithm will:
1. Adjust trade proportions based on price differences
2. Prioritize critical industry demands
3. Ensure minimum supply to each market
4. Optimize remaining allocation efficiently

    This function adjusts historical trade proportions based on current prices and
    preferences. It uses a temperature parameter to control price sensitivity and
    handles special treatment of Rest of World (ROW) trade.

    The adjustment process:
    1. For origin proportions:
       - Applies price sensitivity using exponential decay
       - Higher prices → Lower proportion (exp(-temperature * price))
       - Normalizes to maintain sum = 1 for each destination

    2. For destination proportions:
       - Maintains historical patterns with ROW adjustment
       - Applies real country prioritization
       - Normalizes to maintain sum = 1 for each origin

    Args:
        n_countries: Number of countries in the model

            Example: [0.3, 0.5, 0.2] means country 0 sends 30% to country 0,
                    50% to country 1, and 20% to country 2

            Shape: (n_countries, n_countries, n_industries)

            Shape: (n_countries + 1, n_industries), last row is ROW
        temperature: Price sensitivity parameter
            Higher values → More sensitive to price differences
            Lower values → More similar to historical proportions

            0.0 = No special treatment for real countries

    Returns:

    Example:
        If temperature = 1.0 and country A's prices are 20% higher than country B:

        with_buyer_value_type: Optional filter for buyer value types

    Example:
    Consider a three-country world trading steel:
    - Country A: Major producer (1000 units), competitive prices ($100/unit)
    - Country B: High domestic demand (800 units), higher prices ($120/unit)
    - Country C: Critical industry needs (200 units), limited production

    The algorithm will:
    1. Ensure minimum supply to critical industries in Country C
    2. Allocate remaining supply based on price competitiveness
    3. Respect historical trade patterns if specified
    4. Handle any excess demand through additional mechanisms

    Notes:
    - The algorithm is highly configurable through its parameters
    - It can operate at different levels of granularity (country/firm)
    - Supports both deterministic and stochastic matching
    - Handles special cases like ROW and priority sectors
