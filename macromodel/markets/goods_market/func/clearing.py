"""Market clearing implementations for the goods market.

This module provides different strategies for clearing the goods market, matching
buyers with sellers while respecting various constraints and priorities. It implements
multiple clearing mechanisms:

1. Default Clearing:
   - Random matching with priority weights
   - Supply chain persistence
   - Excess demand handling

2. Pro-rata Clearing:
   - Proportional allocation based on demands
   - Aggregate supply/demand balancing

3. Water Bucket Clearing:
   - Network flow based allocation
   - Trade proportion preservation
   - Priority-based routing

Each clearing mechanism can be configured to handle:
- Domestic vs international trade preferences
- Supply chain relationships
- Price and quantity adjustments
- Priority-based allocation
- Minimum fill rates

        Unlike an all-industry base-year anchor -- rejected twice for destabilising
        scenarios that move production geography -- this takes
        {industry_index: shares_over_countries} for a chosen few
        industries, and the shares may be updated per year by the caller.  Built for
        sector D: ROW's electricity purchases (international interchange plus
        hydrogen-electrolysis load) belong in the provinces CER says export and make
        hydrogen, not wherever the pool finds slack.  Shares are normalised here; the
        entry for ROW's own position must be 0.  Passing None or {} disables it.

        As a pure first-pass hint the split does NOT bind: the pool backfills whatever an
        origin could not supply, from whichever province has slack.  Measured (S2 pair,
        2026-08-13): Ontario delivered 0.8% of ROW's D demand against a 24.2% anchored
        share -- its supply is fully committed domestically by the time the anchored pass
        runs -- while Quebec delivered 31% against 15.6% and Manitoba 11.5% against 4.4%.
        Two opt-ins close the loop:

        - ``strict``: ROW's demand for an override industry that its anchored origins
          cannot fill is WITHDRAWN, not pooled. Realised exports may run under the index
          while origins grow in; without it the split is decorative for any origin whose
          supply is domestically committed.
        - ``signal_shortfall``: the FRACTION (0..1) of each origin's unfilled allocation
          booked as REAL excess demand on that origin's sellers of that industry (after
          the global excess-demand distribution, which would otherwise hand the signal
          to whichever province has spare supply -- the same defect the split corrects,
          one step earlier). This is what lets an origin PLAN for the order book it
          keeps missing: demand estimation reads recorded excess demand. DAMP IT:
          measured at 1.0 (arm S3), Ontario -- under-filled for 20 straight years --
          over-invested past its share (generation ratio 1.52 vs CER, growth 2.48 vs
          2.05) and its cheapened electricity inflated its own demand; 0.0 (arm S4)
          leaves the origin blind and exports permanently under-run.

    This implementation models market clearing as a network flow problem, where supply
    and demand are distributed through the network like water flowing through buckets.
    The algorithm:

    1. Trade Flow Management:
       - Uses origin and destination trade proportions to guide flows
       - Adjusts flows based on price differentials between countries
       - Maintains historical trade relationships while allowing for adaptation

    2. Priority-Based Allocation:
       - Handles high-priority buyers (e.g., critical industries) first
       - Supports both deterministic and stochastic seller selection
       - Allows for domestic market preference

    3. Multi-Stage Clearing:
       - First clears according to trade proportions if enabled
       - Then performs general clearing for remaining supply/demand
       - Finally handles excess demand and additional ROW exports

    4. Price Sensitivity:
       - Incorporates price differences in seller selection
       - Adjusts trade flows based on price competitiveness
       - Applies markups for additional ROW exports

    Key Features:
    - Network flow optimization for efficient allocation
    - Support for minimum fill rates for both buyers and sellers
    - Flexible priority system for critical market participants
    - Sophisticated handling of international trade flows
    - Robust excess demand management

           - Ensures positive prices for all industries

        2. Trade Proportion-Based Clearing:
           - If enabled, first clears according to historical trade patterns
           - Adjusts proportions based on price competitiveness
           - Processes each country pair sequentially

        3. General Clearing:
           - Clears remaining supply and demand without trade constraints
           - Uses price-weighted matching for efficiency

        4. Excess Demand Handling:
           - Processes any remaining excess demand
           - Applies water bucket algorithm for fair distribution

        5. Additional ROW Exports:
           - If enabled, allows extra purchases from ROW
           - Applies price markup for additional exports
           - Prioritizes critical industries
