"""Labour market simulation and clearing mechanism.

This module implements the core labour market functionality, managing employment
relationships between firms and individuals across industries. It handles job
matching, wage determination, and employment status tracking.

Key Features:
1. Employment Management:
   - Job matching between firms and individuals
   - Industry-specific employment tracking
   - Employment status transitions
   - Workforce allocation

2. Market Clearing:
   - Supply-demand matching
   - Wage determination
   - Employment adjustments
   - Labour cost calculation

3. Employment Dynamics:
   - New hires tracking
   - Firing mechanisms
   - Voluntary quits
   - Industry transitions

4. Market Analysis:
   - Employment statistics
   - Labour costs
   - Industry distribution
   - Market efficiency metrics
