"""Labour market clearing mechanisms and algorithms.

This module implements various algorithms for matching workers with firms in
the labour market. It provides an abstract base class for market clearing
and several concrete implementations with different matching strategies.

Key Components:
1. Market Clearing Strategies:
   - Default clearing with productivity-based matching
   - No-op clearing for testing
   - Poledna-style clearing with optimized matching
   - Random and deterministic firing mechanisms

2. Employment Dynamics:
   - Hiring processes with speed constraints
   - Firing with productivity considerations
   - Random separations
   - Voluntary quits

3. Matching Features:
   - Industry-specific matching
   - Reservation wage consideration
   - Productivity-based sorting
   - Employment transition costs

4. Market Frictions:
   - Hiring and firing speeds
   - Industry switching costs
   - Search and matching frictions
   - Employment adjustment costs

The module supports various labour market features including:
- Multi-industry employment
- Wage bargaining
- Productivity-based sorting
- Employment protection
- Labour mobility
