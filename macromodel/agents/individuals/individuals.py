"""Individual agent implementation in macroeconomic modeling.

This module implements the Individual agent class, representing individual
economic actors who:
- Participate in labor markets
- Generate income from various sources
- Form households
- Make investment decisions
- Receive social benefits

The implementation captures:
- Individual characteristics (demographics, education)
- Economic activities (employment, investment)
- Income generation and expectations
- Household relationships
- Labor market behavior

Individuals are the fundamental microeconomic units that:
- Group into households for consumption/investment
- Supply labor to firms
- Generate income through various channels
- Receive government transfers
- Hold investments in firms/banks
