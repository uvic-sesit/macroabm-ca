# Per-agent goods-market transaction series, appended once per agent per counterparty
# per step.  These dominate a long run's memory: measured on a 89-step provincial run,
# they are 97.3% of the ~30 GB the simulation holds (households 18.2 GB, ROW 10.9 GB,
# every other group together 0.8 GB), because `TimeSeries` appends one
# (n_transactors, n_industries) array per key per step and never releases it.  Cost is
# strictly linear in the horizon, so extending 2035 -> 2050 is what pushes a 16 GB
# machine past its commit limit.
#
# Nothing in the model reads their HISTORY.  They are written here and read back only
# through `current()` (households.py, splitting spending into consumption and
# investment), so a run that does not write the full HDF5 export can cap them to the
# last few entries.  See `Agent.history_limit`.
#
# EXACT NAMES, never prefixes.  `real_amount_bought_as_capital_goods` and
# `real_amount_bought_as_intermediate_inputs` are firm series that ARE read with
# `historic()` (and exported), and a prefix match on "real_amount_bought" would silently
# truncate them -- the failure would surface as wrong capital formation, not as an error.
#
# BUYER SIDE ONLY, and deliberately so.  The seller-side series are excluded because
# `Simulation.shallow_hdf_save` writes firms' `real_amount_sold` through
# `industry_timeseries_dataframes()`; trimming it truncated that export from (69, 43) to
# (4, 43) in testing, silently, while every other output stayed identical.  The exclusion
# costs almost nothing: the seller series are 1-D (n_transactors_sell) while the buyer
# series are 2-D (n_transactors_buy, n_industries), and the buyer side is ~93% of the
