"""Government consumption determination strategies.

This module implements various approaches for determining government
consumption targets, including:
- Autoregressive forecasting
- Constant growth assumptions
- Exogenous consumption paths

The consumption strategies consider:
- Historical consumption patterns
- Price level adjustments
- Growth expectations
- Inflation expectations
- Financial constraints
