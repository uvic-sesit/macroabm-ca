"""Technical coefficients productivity growth module.

This module implements mechanisms for improving the productivity of technical coefficients
(intermediate and capital input productivity matrices) through targeted investment.
Unlike TFP which affects all inputs uniformly, technical coefficient improvements are
input-specific, allowing firms to strategically improve efficiency for particular inputs.

Architecture note:
- Base technical coefficients are [n_industries x n_industries] matrices (shared by industry)
- Each firm has multipliers [n_firms x n_industries] that modify these base coefficients
- Effective coefficient for firm i in industry k using input j: base[k,j] * multiplier[i,j]
