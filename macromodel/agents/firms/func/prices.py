        the CSV price series, and divides by the value at initial_year.

        The price file is ANNUAL while the model steps quarterly, so the final calendar
        year's Q2-Q4 fall past its last point: a run ending in 2050 asks for 2050.25 and
        a bounded interpolator raises.  This only bites when the horizon reaches the end
        of the price data, which is why it survived every run ending well short of it.

        CLAMPED rather than extrapolated, and the distinction is not cosmetic.  Passing
        `fill_value="extrapolate"` stops scipy delegating linear interpolation to
        `np.interp` (`_call_linear_np`) and switches it to its own `_call_linear`, which
        differs in the last bit: 15 of the 145 quarters a 2014-2050 run requests move by
        ~1e-16 relative.  In this model that is not negligible -- the perturbation is
        amplified to 2e-08 by 2017 and to 18% (Ontario) and 55% (Alberta) of GDP by 2036,
        so the whole path shifts and results stop being comparable with earlier runs.
        Clamping keeps the fast path and is bit-identical in range, confining the change
        to the quarters that previously raised.

        Holding the last annual value flat across the final year's quarters is also the
        honest reading of an annual series: the file says what 2050 is, not what its Q4
        is.  `rest_of_the_world.func.prices._normalised_price` does extrapolate there;
        that difference is left alone deliberately, since changing it would move ROW's
        in-range numbers the same way and break comparability for the same reason.
