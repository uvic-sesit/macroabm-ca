        previous stock and its desired production *growth rate*. The stock-gap term

           to a ratio of 1.0, giving K_ref = K_{t-1} => gap = 0 => investment falls
           back to pure replacement. This is neutral: it neither sheds the stock nor
           expands it, and simply declines to infer a growth rate from a zero base.

        2. K_{t-1} == 0: the rolling reference degenerates to K_ref = 0, so the gap
           is 0 and the gap term can never rebuild the stock - an absorbing
           zero-capital state (the base-year rule avoids this because its reference
           is keyed to the non-zero base-year stock). Fall back to the base-year
           reference for those entries, which yields gap < 0 and therefore positive
           recovery investment.
