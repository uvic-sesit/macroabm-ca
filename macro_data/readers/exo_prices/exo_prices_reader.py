    Holds a DataFrame of price trajectories keyed by industry (sector) name.
    Each column is a sector; the index is years. Prices are sector-level:
    all firms within a listed sector follow the same normalised trajectory,
    computed at runtime by SectorExogenousPriceSetter.

    Attributes:
        prices: DataFrame with years as index and sector names as columns.
        initial_year: Base year for price normalisation.
        initial_model_prices: Per-firm anchor prices injected from the model
            at construction time; each firm is scaled by its own anchor so
            relative price levels within a sector are preserved.
        nominal_scale: Multiplier applied on top of the normalised file path
            every step (default 1.0 = the file is used as is). A caller that
            supplies the file in REAL terms can drive this from the model's
            own price level (e.g. CPI(t-1)/CPI(0)) through a prehook, so the
            exogenous sectors inflate with the economy they sit in instead of
            at a rate fixed in advance.

    The CSV must have years as the row index and sector (industry) codes as
    column headers. Column names must match the ISIC Rev. 4 codes used by the
    model — either aggregated (e.g. "D", "B", "C19") or detailed (e.g. "B05",
    "C19", "D") depending on the industries list the model is configured with.
    Each column represents a sector-level price trajectory; the setter applies
    the same normalised path to all firms within that sector. Values are prices
    in any consistent unit; the setter normalises them to the initial year.

    Example CSV layout (aggregated industries, initial_year=2014):

        year,D,B
        2013,100.0,80.0
        2014,102.5,85.0
        2015,106.0,91.0
        2030,130.0,110.0

    Start one year before initial_year so that Q1 of the first simulation
    year (which maps to initial_year − 0.25) stays within the interpolation
    range.
