"""
This module provides functionality for reading and processing data from the ECB's Household
Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). The HFCS is a detailed survey that collects household-level
data on households' finances and consumption patterns across European countries.

Key Features:
- Read and process HFCS survey data from multiple waves
- Handle both household and individual level data
- Convert monetary values to local currency units
- Map standardized variable names
- Filter and clean survey responses

The module supports reading various types of HFCS data:
1. Individual data (P files): Personal characteristics, income, employment
2. Household data (H files): Assets, liabilities, consumption
3. Derived data (D files): Calculated variables and aggregates

Example:
    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    from macro_data.readers.population_data.hfcs_reader import HFCSReader
    from macro_data.readers.economic_data.exchange_rates import ExchangeRatesReader

    # Initialize exchange rates reader
    exchange_rates = ExchangeRatesReader(...)

    # Read HFCS data for Germany in 2017
    hfcs = HFCSReader.from_csv(
        country_name="Germany",
        country_name_short="DE",
        year=2017,
        hfcs_data_path=Path("path/to/hfcs/data"),
        exchange_rates=exchange_rates
    )

    # Access household and individual data
    households = hfcs.households_df
    individuals = hfcs.individuals_df
    ```

Note:
    All monetary values are converted to local currency units using the provided
    exchange rates.
