"""
This module provides functionality for reading and processing World Bank exchange rate data.
It supports various currency conversions between USD, EUR, and local currency units (LCU)
for different countries and time periods.

Key Features:
- Read exchange rate data from CSV files
- Convert between USD, EUR, and local currencies
- Support for annual exchange rates
- Handle special cases (e.g., ROW as USA)
- Prune historical data by date

Example:
    ```python
    from pathlib import Path
    from macro_data.readers.economic_data.exchange_rates import ExchangeRatesReader

    # Initialize reader with exchange rate data
    reader = ExchangeRatesReader.from_csv(
        path=Path("path/to/exchange_rates.csv")
    )

    # Convert EUR to local currency for Japan in 2020
    jpy_rate = reader.from_eur_to_lcu("JPN", 2020)

    # Get all exchange rates for 2020
    rates_2020 = reader.exchange_rates_dict(2020)

    # Convert between USD and local currency
    to_usd = reader.to_usd("GBR", 2020)
    from_usd = reader.from_usd("GBR", 2020)
    ```

Note:
    Exchange rates are stored relative to USD (i.e., LCU per USD).
    ROW (Rest of World) is treated as USA for exchange rate purposes.
