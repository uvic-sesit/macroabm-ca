"""Module for managing synthetic population data in macroeconomic simulations.

This module provides the abstract base class for synthetic population generation and management.
It defines the core data structures and interfaces for representing households and individuals
in a macroeconomic simulation, with a focus on:

1. Population Structure:
   - Household composition and relationships
   - Individual demographics and employment
   - Financial status and wealth distribution
   - Housing tenure and property ownership

2. Economic Attributes:
   - Income sources (employment, transfers, assets)
   - Wealth composition (real assets, financial assets)
   - Debt obligations and credit relationships
   - Consumption and saving patterns

3. Data Management:
   - Data validation and cleaning
   - Missing value imputation
   - Statistical modeling of relationships
   - Scale factor adjustments

4. Market Relationships:
   - Employment connections with firms
   - Banking relationships
   - Housing market participation
   - Investment behavior

The module supports both EU and non-EU country data, with capabilities for:
- Data harmonization across sources
- Consistent initialization of economic relationships
- Preservation of aggregate economic constraints
- Environmental impact tracking

Note:
    This module focuses on preprocessing and organizing population data for
    initialization. The actual behavioral dynamics are implemented in the
    simulation package.

Example:
    ```python
    from macro_data.processing.synthetic_population import SyntheticPopulation

    class CustomPopulation(SyntheticPopulation):
        def __init__(self, country_name, scale, ...):
            super().__init__(...)

        def compute_household_income(self, total_social_transfers):
            # Custom income computation logic
            pass

        def compute_household_wealth(self):
            # Custom wealth computation logic
            pass
    ```
